      <p>"Why so much?" many people ask. To answer simply - because they require a lot of work. At least, to do them properly. And of all of the investments that you will make for your business, your logo & branding is one area where you don't want to skimp.</p>
      <p>In business, image is everything. And while your overall brand is based on far more than just your logo, a bad logo can create a strong first impression (for better or for worse).</p>

        how to properly use the logo, several versions of the logo that are print-ready, and can be sent to any
